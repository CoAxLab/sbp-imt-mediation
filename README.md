The repository contains the following directories:

- `data`: At the moment, this folder only contains the nifti and gifti files used for plotting and masking. The data file with the information about IMT and cardiovascular reactivity contains sensitive information about participants. As a result, this file could be provided upon request after removing this sensitive info.
- notebooks: The notebooks used, mainly to generate the plots.
- plots: This folders contains the generated plots.
- scripts: The script files used to run the different experiments.
- src: Source files used by scripts and notebooks.
